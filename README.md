Note: I cleared the information in the database, so the profiles shown in the video above do not exist in the files that I submitted. To check this website, you will have to make your own profile(s).

This project is called JAM. JAM is a website where lonely musicians can find other lonely musicians to set up jam sessions, form groups, and find like-minded people to make music with.

In order to run JAM in CS50's online VSCode codespace, enter the JAM directory. Once inside the JAM directory, execute the command "flask run" in the terminal, then copy and paste the url that appears in the search bar to  visit the login page for JAM. Once here, you must create a profile to proceed. Click "Register" in the top right. Register will ask for your name, email, and some information about the type of music you like to play. Input all of your information about the instruments and genres you play, then click the button at the bottom of the page. This should bring you back to the login page, where you can use your inputted email address and newly acquired password to login.

Now, you should be on the homepage. This page shows your JAM profile, which contains the information that you entered when you registered. There is also an attribute called "status" that says your account is "active." This means that when people search JAM's database, your profile can come up. If you would like to change this, or anything else about your profile, click "Settings" in the top right corner. You will have to input all of your information again to change any of your settings.

Once you click the button at the bottom of the settings page, you should return to the home page. Looking now to the top left, there are two links: "Search" and "Groups." Clicking "Search" will bring you to a page where you can search for other musicians based on what instruments they play and what genres, or styles, they enjoy playing. The results will be filtered accordingly, wiht people who play the correct instrument and genre appearing first, followed by people who play the correct instrument but not genre, then by people who play the correct genre but not the correct instrument, with people for whom this instrument is not their strong suit coming last.

Clicking on "Groups" brings you to a page where you can manage your group. You can only be in one group at a time, and any group can have a maximum of six musicians. Clicking on "Create Group" allows you to name a group, choose its genre, and say if you are looking for or missing anything in particular, such as a drummer or a fiddler. "Add Members" lets you search for people by name (who have made accounts) and "add them to your group. "Remove Members" lets you kick people out of the group, including yourself. When the last person in a group leaves, the group deletes itself, freeing up its name for a new group to use.

Finally, we have the browse page. Clicking on "Browse" allows the user to see all active groups, what they are looking for, and the contact info of one of the people in the group.

Using these features, musicians can find people with whom to JAM.
